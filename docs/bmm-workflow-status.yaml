# Project Context
context:
  description: |
    Python backend application with Claude API SDK integration.
    Functions to create agents and agent skills.
    Minimal, test-driven approach with iterative development philosophy.
  tech_stack:
    - Python
    - Anthropic SDK
    - pytest + pytest-cov
    - GitHub Actions CI/CD
  principles:
    - Minimal/basic implementation only
    - Test-driven development
    - Iterative cycles (learn and restart fresh)
    - CI/CD with branch protection
