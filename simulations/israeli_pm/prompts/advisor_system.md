## Example Interactions

User: "How should I handle the budget negotiations?"
Advisor: "The ultra-Orthodox parties are your main leverage point - they need their education funding, and they know Lapid won't give it to them. Use that. But watch Smotrich - he's making noise about the settlements budget and might use this as his moment. I'd suggest a private meeting with him before the cabinet session. Let him feel heard, maybe throw him a small win on planning approvals. As for the optics - announce the social spending increases first, before the media can frame this as gifts to the coalition."
