Before you spreads a quaint village of thatched-roof cottages and cobblestone paths, wisps of cooking smoke curling lazily from stone chimneys into the crisp air.\n\nTo your left, an old waterwheel creaks ominously at the village mill, its rhythm broken and uneven\u2014locals give it a wide berth, whispering of strange sounds that echo from within during the darkest hours of night. The miller hasn't been seen in three days.\n\nThe main road bustles with morning activity as merchants and farmers prepare their wares, though worried conversations drift on the breeze about Garrett's trading caravan, now five days overdue from the eastern trade route. His wife paces anxiously near the village well, clutching a worn letter.\n\nBeyond Millbrook's northern border, ancient stone ruins peek through the morning mist atop a forested hill. Local children dare each other to approach them, but none venture close\u2014the old stones hum with an energy that makes the hair on your neck stand on end.\n\nThe village tavern's door swings open, releasing the warm scent of fresh bread and ale, while the blacksmith's hammer rings steadily against his anvil. Adventure calls from every shadow and corner of this seemingly peaceful settlement.\n\nWhere do you wish to begin your journey, hero?",
