Rain patters against diamond-paned windows while a fire crackles in the stone hearth, casting dancing shadows across weathered wooden tables. The mingled scents of roasted meat, ale, and wet wool fill your nostrils.\n\nYou find yourself in the trading town of Millbrook, where three major roads converge\u2014making it a hub for merchants, travelers, and those seeking fortune or fleeing trouble. The tavern buzzes with quiet conversation, but you notice several opportunities for adventure:\n\nAt a corner table, a hooded figure nervously glances toward the door while clutching a leather satchel. Near the bar, a grizzled merchant loudly complains about bandits making the northern road \"impassable for honest folk.\" By the fireplace, an elderly woman in tattered robes mutters about strange lights seen in the abandoned Thornwick Manor.\n\nThe tavern keeper, a stout woman with flour-dusted hands, approaches with a welcoming smile. \"Welcome to the Crossroads, traveler! What'll it be\u2014a room for the night, a hot meal, or perhaps you're looking for work?\"\n\nWhat do you do?",
