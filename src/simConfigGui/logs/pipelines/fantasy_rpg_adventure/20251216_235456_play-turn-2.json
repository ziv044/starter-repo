Inside, amber lamplight flickers across weathered wooden tables where weary travelers nurse their ales and speak in hushed tones. The air is thick with the scent of roasted meat, pipe smoke, and something else\u2014an undercurrent of tension that has settled over the common room like morning fog.\n\nYou sit alone at a corner table, your traveling cloak still damp from the storm outside. The innkeeper, a stout woman with knowing eyes, approaches with a steaming bowl of stew and fresh bread.\n\n\"Dark night to be traveling these roads,\" she murmurs, setting down your meal. \"Especially with all the strange happenings of late. Merchants going missing on the King's Highway, lights dancing in the Whispering Woods where no lights should be...\" She glances toward the rain-streaked windows. \"Course, might just be the storm making folk see things.\"\n\nAt a nearby table, a hooded figure in travel-stained robes suddenly stands, coins clinking as they're hastily scattered across the wooden surface. The stranger hurries toward the door, but pauses and turns back, eyes finding yours across the smoky room.\n\n\"The old tower,\" they whisper urgently, just loud enough for you to hear. \"Three days hence, when the moon goes dark. If you seek purpose... if you seek answers...\"\n\nThe door slams shut behind them, leaving only the sound of rain and crackling fire.\n\nWhat do you do?",
