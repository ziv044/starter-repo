Thatched-roof cottages line the main road, their chimneys releasing thin wisps of smoke into the crisp dawn air. The sound of a blacksmith's hammer rings steadily from a workshop ahead, while chickens peck and cluck around wooden fences.\n\nYou've arrived here with little more than basic traveling gear and a handful of copper coins. Your stomach growls\u2014you haven't eaten since yesterday.\n\nAs you take in your surroundings, you notice commotion near the village square. A small crowd has gathered around a weathered wooden notice board, their voices carrying tones of worry and excitement. An elderly woman in a flour-dusted apron catches your eye and calls out:\n\n\"You there, stranger! You look like you might have some spine about you. Come see this\u2014we've got ourselves a problem that needs solving, and the village coffers might spare a few silver pieces for the right person.\"\n\nThe crowd parts slightly, revealing a hastily written notice nailed to the board. What do you do?",
