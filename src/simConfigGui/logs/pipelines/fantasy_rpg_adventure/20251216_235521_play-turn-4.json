Ancient stone markers, worn smooth by countless seasons, point toward distant settlements: *Millbrook* to the east, *The Thornwood* to the north, and *Greyspire* to the west. The wind carries an unsettling mixture of wood smoke and something else\u2014something metallic and wrong.\n\nA merchant's wagon lies overturned in the ditch beside you, its cargo of grain scattered across the muddy ground. Deep gouges rake the wagon's sides, too large and jagged to be from any common beast. No sign of the merchant or their horses, though dark stains spatter the torn canvas.\n\nFrom the northern road comes the distant sound of bells\u2014not the cheerful chiming of a village celebration, but a frantic, discordant clanging that speaks of alarm. The other roads stretch empty into the gathering dusk.\n\nA leather satchel has tumbled from the wrecked wagon, its contents spilling across the stones. Among scattered coins glints something that catches your eye\u2014a sealed letter bearing an official wax seal.\n\nThe bells continue their urgent warning. Shadows grow longer. \n\nWhat do you do?",
