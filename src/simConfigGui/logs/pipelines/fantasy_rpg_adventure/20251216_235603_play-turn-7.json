The Crossroads Tavern sits at the junction of three ancient roads, and tonight it shelters only a handful of weary travelers like yourself. Rain drums against diamond-paned windows while shadows dance across timber walls adorned with faded maps and hunting trophies.\n\nThe tavern keeper, a grizzled man named Gareth, wipes down pewter mugs with practiced efficiency. His worried glances toward the eastern window haven't gone unnoticed\u2014that road leads to Millbrook, a farming village that should have sent their weekly supply cart two days ago.\n\nAs if summoned by your observation, the tavern door crashes open. A young woman staggers inside, her traveling cloak torn and muddied, eyes wide with terror. She collapses against the doorframe, gasping:\n\n\"Please... someone must help! Millbrook... the shadows in the wheat... they took them all!\"\n\nThe few other patrons shrink back into their ale, avoiding eye contact. Gareth sets down his mug with trembling hands. The woman's desperate gaze falls upon you, the only soul who hasn't looked away.\n\nWhat do you do?",
