The familiar warmth embraces you\u2014crackling hearth, the rich aroma of roasted meat, and the low murmur of evening patrons. This waystation sits where three major roads converge: the King's Highway stretching north toward the capital, the Merchant's Road winding east through fertile valleys, and the Old Forest Path disappearing south into shadowed woods.\n\nYou settle at your usual table near the window when the tavern door BANGS open. A young woman stumbles inside, her traveling cloak torn and muddy, eyes wide with terror. She collapses near the entrance, gasping:\n\n\"Please... someone must help! The children of Millbrook village\u2014they've vanished! Every last one, taken in the night!\" She clutches a small, strangely carved wooden doll. \"The constable won't listen, says they probably just wandered off, but I know better. Something *unnatural* stalks those woods.\"\n\nThe tavern falls silent. Several patrons exchange nervous glances before quickly returning to their drinks. The woman's desperate gaze sweeps the room, finally settling on you.\n\n**What do you do?**",
