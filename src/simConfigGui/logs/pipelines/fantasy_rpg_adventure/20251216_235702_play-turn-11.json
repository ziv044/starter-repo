Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the canopy above, casting dancing shadows across the moss-covered ground. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and wild honeysuckle.\n\nYou stand at the edge of a well-worn dirt path that winds deeper into the woods. Behind you lies the familiar comfort of Millhaven village, where you've spent the last peaceful night at the Copper Kettle inn. Ahead, the forest seems to whisper secrets in a language just beyond understanding.\n\nYour hand instinctively moves to the leather pouch at your belt\u2014inside rests the cryptic letter that arrived three days ago, bearing only a wax seal you don't recognize and the words: *\"The old oak remembers what the village has forgotten. Come alone when the morning mist rises.\"*\n\nAs you contemplate your next move, you notice something peculiar: fresh footprints in the soft earth beside the path, far too large to belong to any human. They head directly into the darker depths of the forest, parallel to the main trail.\n\nWhat do you do?",
