You sit hunched over a half-empty mug of ale, the amber liquid now lukewarm in your hands. Around you, the tavern buzzes with the low murmur of evening patrons - traveling merchants counting their coin, local farmers discussing the strange blight affecting their crops, and a hooded figure in the corner who hasn't touched their drink in over an hour.*\n\n*Rain patters against the diamond-paned windows, and the fire in the great hearth crackles, casting dancing light across your worn travel clothes. Your purse is lighter than you'd like, containing perhaps enough for another night's lodging and a modest breakfast. The road has been long, and opportunities scarce.*\n\n*Suddenly, the tavern door bursts open with a crash, admitting both a gust of cold wind and a wild-eyed young woman. Her cloak is torn, her boots caked with mud, and her breath comes in ragged gasps. She stumbles forward, scanning the room desperately before her eyes lock onto yours.*\n\n*\"Please,\" she gasps, approaching your table with trembling hands, \"I need help. My village... something terrible has happened to Millbrook.\"*\n\nThe tavern falls silent, all eyes turning toward this dramatic interruption.\n\nWhat do you do?",
