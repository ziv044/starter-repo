Outside, autumn rain patters against diamond-paned windows, and the wind howls through the mountain pass. This remote inn sits at the junction of three ancient roads - one leading to the coastal city of Saltmere, another winding toward the dwarven holds in the Ironspine Mountains, and the third disappearing into the shadowy depths of Thornwood Forest.\n\nThe tavern buzzes with hushed conversations. A hooded merchant nervously clutches a leather satchel, glancing repeatedly at the door. Near the hearth, a grizzled dwarf traces routes on a worn map while muttering about \"the old mine shafts.\" At the bar, the innkeeper - a stout woman named Marta - wipes down tankards with obvious worry creasing her brow.\n\nThunder crashes overhead, and the tavern door suddenly bursts open. A figure in a tattered cloak stumbles inside, rain-soaked and gasping. Blood seeps through torn fabric on their arm.\n\n\"Please...\" the stranger rasps, scanning the room desperately. \"I must... warn someone... they're coming...\"\n\nThe stranger's eyes lock with yours across the crowded tavern.\n\nWhat do you do?",
