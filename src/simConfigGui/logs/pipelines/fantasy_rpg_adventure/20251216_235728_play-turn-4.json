You stand before the Crossroads Inn, a two-story timber building with warm yellow light spilling from its diamond-paned windows into the gathering dusk. The scent of roasted meat and ale drifts from within, along with the low murmur of voices.\n\nThis inn sits at the junction of three roads: the King's Highway stretching north toward the capital, a winding forest path leading east into the Thornwood, and a rough cart track heading south toward the mining settlements in the Greystone Hills.\n\nA travel-stained merchant hurries past you, clutching his pack tightly as he glances nervously at the darkening treeline. From inside the inn, you hear raised voices\u2014not quite an argument, but animated discussion growing louder.\n\nA wooden notice board beside the inn's heavy oak door bears several parchments fluttering in the breeze, and through the nearest window, you glimpse cloaked figures huddled around a corner table, speaking in hushed, urgent tones.\n\nThe inn door stands open, inviting weary travelers to enter and warm themselves by the hearth. What draws your attention first in this moment between day and night?",
