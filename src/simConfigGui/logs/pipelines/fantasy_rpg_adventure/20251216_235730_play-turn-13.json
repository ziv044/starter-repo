Shafts of golden light pierce through the canopy, illuminating dancing motes of pollen and casting long shadows across the moss-covered forest floor. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and wild honeysuckle.\n\nYou stand at the edge of a narrow dirt path that winds deeper into the woods, your leather boots crunching softly on fallen leaves. Behind you lies the familiar smoke of your village's chimneys, but ahead... ahead lies mystery. The locals speak in hushed tones of strange lights flickering between the trees at night, and of travelers who venture too deep and return speaking of ruins older than memory.\n\nA gentle breeze stirs the branches overhead, carrying with it the distant sound of running water and something else\u2014a faint, melodic humming that seems to beckon you forward.\n\nYour worn traveling pack sits comfortably across your shoulders, containing your meager provisions and a few essential tools. At your side hangs a simple but well-maintained sword, its leather grip familiar in your hand.\n\nThe path splits ahead into two directions: one leads toward the sound of water to the east, while the other curves north deeper into the shadowed heart of the forest.\n\nWhat do you choose to do?",
