Warm amber light spills across weathered floorboards, and the comforting aroma of roasted meat and ale fills your nostrils.\n\nThe tavern buzzes with quiet conversation - merchants counting coin at corner tables, local farmers nursing their drinks, and a hooded figure sitting alone near the great stone hearth. Behind the bar, a stout dwarf with braided silver beard polishes mugs while eyeing the room with practiced caution.\n\nAs you step inside, shaking droplets from your cloak, several conversations pause. Strangers are noticed in the mountain village of Millhaven, especially ones bearing the worn leather and steel that mark you as more than a simple traveler.\n\nThe tavern keeper nods in your direction. \"Room's two silver, hot meal's another. Storm's getting worse out there - might be wise to stay the night.\"\n\nThrough the rain-streaked windows, you catch glimpses of flickering torches moving unusually through the village streets. Something has the locals stirred up tonight.\n\n*What do you do?*",
