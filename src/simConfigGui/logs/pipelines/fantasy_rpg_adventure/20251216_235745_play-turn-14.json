The wooden sign creaks in the evening breeze: *\"Millhaven - Where Four Roads Meet.\"*\n\nBehind you, the road stretches back toward distant mountains, their peaks already dusted with early snow. Ahead, three paths diverge from the town square: \n\n- The **King's Road** continues north, paved stones leading toward the capital\n- A narrow **forest path** winds east into the Whisperwood, where shadows dance between ancient trees  \n- The **merchant's trail** heads west toward the coast, rutted with wagon wheels\n\nThe warm glow of *The Prancing Pony* tavern spills golden light across the square, and you catch fragments of conversation and clinking tankards. A weathered notice board stands nearby, papers fluttering with job postings and news. \n\nAn old woman in a dark shawl hurries past, glancing at you nervously before disappearing into an alley. The town watch captain, a grizzled man with a distinctive scar across his jaw, observes you from his post near the fountain.\n\nThe night is young, and Millhaven holds its secrets close. Where do you choose to begin your tale?",
