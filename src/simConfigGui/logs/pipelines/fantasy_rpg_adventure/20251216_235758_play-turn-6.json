Flickering candlelight dances across weathered stone walls, casting long shadows between the rough-hewn tables where locals nurse their ales in hushed conversation. The air is thick with the scent of roasted meat, pipe smoke, and something else\u2014tension.\n\nBehind the bar, a stout dwarf with graying braids polishes a tankard with unusual intensity, his eyes darting toward a cloaked figure seated alone in the far corner. The stranger's hood obscures their face, but you notice their fingers drum impatiently against the scarred wooden table.\n\nRain patters against the diamond-paned windows, and the wind howls through the eaves of this remote roadside inn. You realize you're not the only traveler seeking shelter tonight\u2014but something tells you this won't be an ordinary evening of rest and respite.\n\nThe dwarf barkeep looks up as you approach, relief flickering across his weathered features. \"Well met, traveler,\" he says in a low voice. \"Name's Thorek. You picked a strange night to find the Boar, friend. Strange indeed...\"\n\n**What do you do?**",
