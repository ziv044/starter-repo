Warm amber light from flickering candles dances across weathered stone walls, and the scent of roasted meat and ale fills the air. A few travelers huddle around small tables, speaking in hushed tones.\n\nBehind the bar, a stout dwarf with braided grey whiskers polishes a mug while eyeing you with curious interest. In the far corner, a hooded figure sits alone, occasionally glancing toward a rain-soaked notice board near the entrance.\n\nThe tavern keeper calls out in a gruff but friendly voice: \"Welcome, stranger! Foul night to be traveling these mountain roads. What brings you to our humble establishment?\"\n\nYou notice three immediate options: approach the bar to speak with the dwarf, examine the notice board which appears to have several parchments pinned to it, or investigate the mysterious hooded figure in the corner.\n\n*What do you choose to do?*",
