You pull your weathered cloak tighter against the chill, the familiar weight of your sword at your side offering some comfort. After weeks of travel along muddy roads, you've finally reached this frontier settlement - a place where merchants, sellswords, and fortune-seekers gather before venturing into the wild borderlands beyond.\n\nThe warm glow of The Silver Stag tavern spills onto the street ahead, promising hot food and dry shelter. But as you approach, you notice something odd - the usual evening bustle is absent. No merchants hawking last-minute wares, no children playing in the square. Instead, clusters of townspeople whisper urgently in doorways, their faces etched with worry.\n\nA sudden crash echoes from a nearby alley, followed by a woman's frightened cry. The few people still on the street scatter quickly, disappearing into buildings and slamming doors behind them.\n\nYou stand at a crossroads - literally and figuratively. The tavern's warmth beckons, the mysterious disturbance demands investigation, or perhaps you'd rather seek out what has the entire town so spooked.\n\nWhat do you do?",
