The common room buzzes with weary travelers seeking shelter from the storm. Your worn leather pack rests beside your chair, containing your meager possessions: a sturdy oak walking staff, a small eating knife, a coinpurse with barely enough copper for tonight's lodging, and a mysterious sealed letter that arrived this morning bearing only your name.\n\nThe tavern keeper, a stout woman with flour-dusted aprons, approaches your table with concern creasing her weathered face.\n\n\"Stranger, you've been staring at that letter all evening. Bad news from home?\" She glances toward the rain-lashed windows. \"Though I suppose any news that brings folk out in weather like this must be urgent indeed.\"\n\nAt a nearby table, three cloaked figures huddle over a map, speaking in hushed tones about \"the old ruins\" and \"something stirring in the Thornwood.\" Their conversation stops abruptly when they notice your attention.\n\nLightning illuminates the tavern's interior, and for a moment, the sealed letter in your hands seems to pulse with an otherworldly warmth.\n\nWhat do you do?",
