The morning mist clings to thatched roofs as nervous villagers hurry about their business, casting worried glances toward the ancient stone bridge that spans the Silverrun River.\n\nOld Henrik, the village elder, approaches with troubled eyes. \"The bridge... it's been singing again,\" he says, voice barely above a whisper. \"Strange lights dance beneath the water at night, and travelers who cross after dark speak of hearing voices calling their names.\"\n\nBeyond the bridge, three paths diverge into the wilderness:\n\nTo the **north**, the Thornwood Forest looms dark and dense, its canopy so thick that daylight barely penetrates. Smoke rises from somewhere deep within its shadows.\n\nTo the **east**, rolling hills stretch toward distant mountains where an abandoned watchtower stands silhouetted against the sky, its purpose long forgotten.\n\nTo the **west**, the road winds toward the ruins of Ravenhollow, a once-prosperous trading post that fell to some calamity decades ago.\n\nHenrik wrings his weathered hands. \"Strange times, stranger. The bridge connects our world to... other places. Whatever path you choose, tread carefully.\"\n\nThe morning sun climbs higher, burning away the mist. What draws your attention first?",
