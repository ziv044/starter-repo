The air is thick with the aroma of roasted meat, ale, and the lingering smoke from countless evenings of revelry. Rain patters against diamond-paned windows, while a crackling fire provides warmth against the chill autumn night.\n\nAt scattered wooden tables, an eclectic mix of travelers seeks shelter: merchant caravans counting their coins, road-weary pilgrims clutching holy symbols, and grizzled sellswords sharpening their blades. The tavern keeper, a stout woman with knowing eyes, wipes down mugs while keeping one ear tuned to the gossip flowing as freely as the wine.\n\nIn the far corner, a hooded figure hunches over a barely-touched meal, occasionally glancing toward the entrance with nervous energy. Near the hearth, an old man with a magnificent beard gestures animatedly as he regales younger patrons with tales of ancient ruins discovered in the nearby Thornwood Forest.\n\nThe door bursts open with a gust of wind and rain, drawing every eye as a cloaked messenger stumbles inside, mud-splattered and breathing heavily, clutching a sealed letter marked with an unfamiliar crimson seal.\n\n*The stage is set for adventure to begin...*",
