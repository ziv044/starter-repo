Outside, autumn rain patters steadily against diamond-paned windows, and the wind howls through the eaves like a restless spirit. You sit alone at a corner table, nursing a mug of mulled ale that has long since grown cold.\n\nThe inn sits at the junction of three ancient roads: one leading north to the mist-shrouded Thornwood, another winding east toward the port city of Saltmere, and the third stretching south into the war-torn borderlands. Few travelers venture out on nights like this, but those who do often carry tales worth hearing.\n\nOld Henrik, the innkeeper, wipes down tables with practiced efficiency, his weathered face creased with worry. Every few moments, his eyes drift to the empty chair by the door\u2014the seat usually occupied by his daughter Mira, who should have returned from her herb-gathering expedition hours ago.\n\nThe common room holds only two other souls: a hooded figure hunched over a bowl of stew near the bar, and a nervous-looking merchant who keeps glancing toward the shuttered windows as if expecting unwelcome visitors.\n\nThunder rumbles overhead, and somewhere in the distance, you hear what might be the howl of wolves... or something else entirely.\n\n**What do you do?**",
