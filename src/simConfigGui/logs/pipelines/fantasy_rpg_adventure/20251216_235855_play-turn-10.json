This remote inn sits at the junction of three ancient roads - one leading north to the mist-shrouded Thornwood, another winding east toward the merchant city of Goldenhaven, and the third stretching south into the war-torn borderlands.\n\nInside, the tavern buzzes with hushed conversations. A hooded figure in the corner nurses a tankard while studying a worn map. The innkeeper, a stout woman with worry lines etched deep around her eyes, glances nervously toward the stairs every few moments. At a table near the hearth, two travel-worn merchants argue in whispers about \"missing caravans\" and \"things that hunt in the dark.\"\n\nThunder rumbles overhead as the first drops of rain begin pattering against the diamond-paned windows. You notice several other patrons casting furtive glances your way - some with hope, others with suspicion.\n\nThe innkeeper approaches, wiping her hands on her apron. \"Welcome, traveler. Name's Martha. We've got hot stew and warm beds, though...\" she lowers her voice, \"...strange times these are. Folk have been going missing on all three roads lately.\"\n\nWhat do you do?",
