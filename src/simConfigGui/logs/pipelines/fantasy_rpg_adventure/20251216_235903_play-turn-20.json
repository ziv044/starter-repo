You sit alone at a corner table in the Crossroads Tavern, nursing a mug of bitter ale as rain begins to patter against the diamond-paned windows. The tavern buzzes with the usual evening crowd\u2014merchants counting their coin, farmers drowning their sorrows, and travelers sharing tales of the road.\n\nYour peaceful moment is shattered when the tavern door bursts open with a crash. A young woman stumbles inside, her traveling cloak torn and mud-splattered, her eyes wide with terror. Blood seeps from a gash on her arm as she scans the room desperately.\n\n\"Please!\" she gasps, her voice cutting through the tavern's chatter. \"Someone must help! The village of Thornwick\u2014it's gone! Something terrible has taken everyone!\"\n\nThe tavern falls silent. Patrons exchange uneasy glances, but none rise to aid her. She locks eyes with you across the smoky room, desperation clear in her gaze.\n\nOutside, thunder rumbles ominously, and the rain intensifies against the windows.\n\nWhat do you do?",
