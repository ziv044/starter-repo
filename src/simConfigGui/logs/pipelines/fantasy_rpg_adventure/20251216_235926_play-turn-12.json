Thatched-roof cottages line the main road, their chimneys releasing thin wisps of smoke into the pale sky.\n\nThe village should be bustling with morning activity - farmers heading to their fields, merchants opening their shops, children playing in the streets. Instead, an unsettling quiet hangs over Millbrook like a shroud.\n\nA weathered wooden signpost near the village well bears a hastily scrawled notice, the ink still wet with morning dew. As you approach, you can make out urgent words: *\"MISSING - Elara Brightwater, age 16. Last seen three nights past near the forest edge. REWARD offered. Seek Mayor Aldric at the Copper Kettle Inn.\"*\n\nFrom somewhere deep within the village, you hear the faint sound of worried voices and the creak of a door opening. A figure emerges from the inn - an elderly man with silver hair and deep worry lines etched across his weathered face.\n\nThe adventure begins here, traveler. What draws your attention first in this troubled village?",
