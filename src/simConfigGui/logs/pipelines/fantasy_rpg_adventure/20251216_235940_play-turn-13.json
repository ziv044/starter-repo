The familiar creak of old hinges mingles with the warm hum of conversation and the crackling of the central hearth. Flickering candlelight dances across weathered faces - merchants counting coins, farmers nursing ales, and a cloaked figure in the corner whose eyes seem to follow your movement.\n\nThe tavern sits at the intersection of three ancient roads: one leading north to the mist-shrouded Whispering Hills, another winding east toward the prosperous port city of Goldenhaven, and the third stretching south into the wild Thornwood Forest. Each path promises its own dangers and rewards.\n\nMarta, the tavern keeper, wipes down mugs behind the bar with practiced efficiency. Her knowing smile suggests she's seen countless adventurers pass through these doors, each carrying their own burdens and ambitions.\n\nAs you step inside, three things immediately catch your attention: a weathered bounty notice nailed to the message board near the door, the hushed argument between two hooded travelers at a nearby table, and the way that cloaked figure's hand rests meaningfully on the pommel of their blade.\n\nThe night is young, and the crossroads await your choice. What draws your attention first?",
