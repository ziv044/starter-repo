The sun barely peeks over the thatched rooftops, casting long shadows across the quiet streets.\n\nYou notice three things immediately:\n\n**The Frantic Merchant** - A well-dressed trader named Gareth paces near the inn, wringing his hands. His wagon sits nearby, but his horses are nowhere to be seen. He keeps glancing nervously toward the forest path.\n\n**The Blacksmith's Smoke** - Thick, unusual purple smoke rises from Brunhild's forge at the square's edge. The normally cheerful clang of hammer on anvil has been replaced by an eerie silence.\n\n**The Gathering Crowd** - A small group of villagers whispers urgently near the old stone well. Their faces are pale, and they keep pointing toward the northern road that leads to the abandoned watchtower.\n\nThe air carries an odd tension, as if the very morning itself holds secrets waiting to unfold. Your coin purse jingles lightly at your belt - enough for basic supplies, but adventure calls for more substantial rewards.\n\nWhat draws your attention first?",
