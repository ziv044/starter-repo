You sit hunched over a half-empty mug of ale, the bitter taste matching your mood. Rain patters against the glass as fellow travelers mutter in hushed tones at nearby tables.\n\nThe tavern keeper, a grizzled dwarf named Thorek, wipes down glasses with practiced efficiency. His eyes occasionally dart toward the stairs leading to the upper rooms, where strange scratching sounds have been echoing for the past hour.\n\nA cloaked figure in the corner booth suddenly stands, leaving behind a leather satchel and a few silver coins scattered on the table. They slip out into the storm without a word. The satchel lies there, unattended, while the scratching from upstairs grows more insistent.\n\nThorek catches your eye and jerks his head toward the ceiling. \"That's the third night running,\" he growls under his breath. \"Room seven. Paid for a week in advance, but I ain't seen hide nor hair of whoever's up there since yesterday morning.\"\n\nThunder rolls overhead as three paths present themselves: investigate the mysterious satchel, venture upstairs to solve the scratching mystery, or simply finish your drink and retire for the night.\n\nWhat do you choose?",
