The common room buzzes with hushed conversations that seem to die as patrons glance your way. Flickering candlelight dances across weathered faces - merchants, farmers, and sellswords seeking shelter from both storm and uncertainty.\n\nBehind the bar, a stout dwarf with braided copper hair polishes a mug while eyeing you appraisingly. In the far corner, a hooded figure hunches over a steaming bowl, occasionally glancing toward the stairs leading to the upper rooms. Near the crackling hearth, two local farmers speak in urgent whispers about \"strange lights in Thornwood\" and \"livestock found drained of blood.\"\n\nThe barkeep calls out in a gruff but not unfriendly voice: \"Drink to warm your bones, traveler? Or perhaps you seek a room for the night? Either way, you've chosen a peculiar time to be on the roads...\"\n\nOutside, lightning illuminates the crossroads where three paths diverge - one leading deeper into the kingdom's heartland, another toward the mysterious Thornwood Forest, and the third winding up into the mist-shrouded mountains.\n\nWhat do you do?",
