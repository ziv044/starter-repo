Wisps of smoke curl from chimneys as the villagers begin their daily routines. The scent of fresh bread drifts from the baker's shop, mingling with the earthy smell of the nearby fields.\n\nYou stand at the village's heart, near the old stone well that has served the community for generations. To the north, a cobblestone path leads toward the misty Thornwood Forest. South stretches the main road to larger towns and cities beyond. The local tavern, \"The Prancing Pony,\" shows signs of early morning activity, while the village blacksmith's hammer already rings against his anvil.\n\nAn elderly woman approaches the well, her weathered face creased with worry. She glances nervously toward the forest before noticing you.\n\n\"Oh, thank the gods,\" she whispers urgently. \"Are you a traveler? Please, we need help. Strange howls have been echoing from the Thornwood for three nights now, and yesterday... yesterday young Willem didn't return from gathering herbs.\"\n\nThe morning air grows still, as if the village itself holds its breath, waiting for your response.\n\nWhat do you do?",
