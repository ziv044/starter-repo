Wisps of smoke curl from chimneys of thatched-roof cottages, and the distant sound of a blacksmith's hammer rings through the air.\n\nYou stand at the village crossroads, where four dirt paths converge around an ancient stone well. To the north, the **Prancing Pony Inn** beckons with warm lamplight spilling from its windows and the murmur of evening patrons. The wooden sign creaks gently in the breeze.\n\nTo the east, you notice **Gareth's Smithy**, where orange sparks dance in the growing dusk. A burly man wipes sweat from his brow as he examines a freshly forged blade.\n\nSouth lies the village common, where a small crowd has gathered around an elderly woman gesturing frantically toward the dark treeline of Thornwood Forest.\n\nWest, a narrow path winds up a small hill to what appears to be the village shrine, where a lone figure in brown robes tends to flickering candles.\n\nThe villagers seem on edge\u2014hushed conversations and worried glances suggest something has disturbed the usual peace of Millbrook.\n\nWhat draws your attention first, traveler?",
