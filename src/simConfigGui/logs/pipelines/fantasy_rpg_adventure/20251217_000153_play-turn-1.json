Golden lamplight spills from the diamond-paned windows onto the muddy courtyard where three roads converge - one winding down toward the farming valleys, another climbing into the mist-shrouded peaks, and the third disappearing into the dark expanse of Thornwood Forest.\n\nInside the inn's common room, a fire crackles in the stone hearth, casting dancing shadows across rough-hewn beams. A handful of travelers occupy the tables: a nervous merchant clutching a leather satchel, two cloaked figures whispering urgently in the corner, and a grizzled dwarf nursing an ale while studying a worn map.\n\nThe innkeeper, a stout woman named Marta, wipes down mugs behind the bar with practiced efficiency. She glances up as you enter, her weathered face creasing into a welcoming smile.\n\n\"Well now, another traveler seeking shelter from the growing darkness,\" she says, her voice warm but tinged with concern. \"Strange times these are, with all the talk of lights in the old ruins and caravans going missing on the forest road.\"\n\nThe merchant at the nearby table looks up nervously at her words, his knuckles white around his drink.\n\n*What do you do?*",
