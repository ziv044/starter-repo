Below, what should be a peaceful farming village is ablaze. Orange flames lick hungrily at cottage roofs while panicked screams echo up from the settlement.\n\nYou stand at a weathered stone crossroads, your travel pack heavy on your shoulders. The familiar wooden sign of the **Crossroads Tavern** creaks in the wind beside you\u2014the very establishment where you'd planned to spend the night. But now, urgent choices demand your attention.\n\nTo the north, the main road leads down into burning Millbrook, where you can see dark figures moving between the flames\u2014too large and hulking to be ordinary bandits. To the south, a narrow forest path winds away from the chaos toward the relative safety of Greenvale. To the west, an old mining trail climbs higher into the Thornpeak Mountains.\n\nThe tavern keeper, a stout woman named Marta, bursts from her establishment's door, her face pale with terror. \"By the gods!\" she gasps, spotting you. \"They came from nowhere\u2014twisted things with fangs and claws! The whole village... we have to help them!\"\n\nLightning flickers in the darkening sky above, and you catch the distant sound of inhuman howls carried on the wind.\n\n**What do you do?**",
