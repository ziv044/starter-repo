The scent of roasted meat and ale mingles with the musty smell of old timber and countless travelers' stories. Rain patters against diamond-paned windows while a crackling fire casts dancing shadows across worn wooden tables.\n\nYou've arrived in the frontier town of Millbrook just as storm clouds gather overhead. Your coin purse, though not entirely empty, grows lighter with each passing day. The road that brought you here splits three ways just outside town - north toward the ancient Thornwood Forest, east to the mining settlements of the Ironpeak Mountains, and south toward the coastal trading ports.\n\nAs you settle at a corner table, a hooded figure at the bar catches your attention. They've been watching you since you entered, their weathered hands wrapped around a pewter mug. The barkeep, a stout woman with graying hair, approaches your table.\n\n\"New face in Millbrook,\" she says with a knowing smile. \"You have the look of someone seeking more than just a warm meal and dry bed. Am I right, traveler?\"\n\nThe tavern door rattles suddenly in the wind, and you notice the hooded figure has turned away, but their shoulders remain tense, as if listening intently to your conversation.\n\nWhat do you do?",
