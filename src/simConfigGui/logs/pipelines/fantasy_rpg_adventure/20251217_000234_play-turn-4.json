Three paths stretch before you like fingers reaching into the unknown:\n\nTo the **north**, a narrow trail winds up into the mist-shrouded Thornwood Hills, where locals whisper of ancient ruins and strange lights dancing between the trees.\n\nTo the **east**, the main road continues toward the bustling market town of Goldmere, though recent travelers speak nervously of bandits and something worse stalking the wooded stretches.\n\nTo the **west**, a forgotten path leads toward the abandoned Greystone Mine, sealed twenty years ago after the miners spoke of hearing voices in the deep places where no voices should be.\n\nBehind you, the warm glow of Millbrook's tavern windows beckons, but you sense your destiny lies elsewhere. The weathered signpost creaks in the wind, its carved directions barely legible after decades of storms.\n\nAs you consider your path, you notice fresh horse tracks in the mud\u2014multiple riders, moving fast toward the eastern road. One set of hoofprints is distinctly different, smaller, as if from a pony or mule.\n\nWhat draws your attention first, adventurer?",
