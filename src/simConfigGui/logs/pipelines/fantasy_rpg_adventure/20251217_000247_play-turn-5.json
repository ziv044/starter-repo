Warm firelight flickers across weathered stone walls, casting dancing shadows between the rough-hewn support beams. The air is thick with the scent of roasted meat, ale, and something else\u2014an undercurrent of tension that seems to grip the handful of patrons scattered throughout the common room.\n\nBehind the bar, a stout dwarf with graying braids polishes a mug with mechanical precision, his eyes darting nervously toward a corner table where three cloaked figures speak in hushed, urgent tones. Near the hearth, an elderly woman clutches a steaming bowl of stew, but her food sits untouched as she stares into the flames with haunted eyes.\n\nOutside, thunder rolls across the Thornwick Mountains, and through the rain-streaked windows you catch glimpses of torch-bearing figures moving through the village streets\u2014an unusual sight for this late hour in such weather.\n\nThe dwarf barkeeper notices your entrance and nods grimly. \"Traveler,\" he calls out, \"you've picked a strange night to reach our village. Strange indeed.\"\n\nWhat do you do?",
