You sit at a worn wooden table, nursing a tankard of ale that's grown warm in your distracted hands. The tavern buzzes with the usual evening crowd\u2014merchants counting coin, travelers sharing road stories, and locals drowning their daily sorrows.\n\nYour leather pack rests against your chair, containing the modest provisions of an aspiring adventurer: a sturdy rope, a few days' rations, a small pouch with 20 silver coins, and the basic tools of survival. Your trusty sword hangs at your side, its weight familiar and reassuring.\n\nThree conversations drift to your ears through the tavern's din:\n\nA grizzled merchant mutters about **bandits on the Northern Pass** who've been preying on trade caravans, offering good coin for their removal.\n\nTwo hooded figures whisper urgently about **strange lights** emanating from the ruins of Millbrook Abbey, abandoned since the plague years.\n\nThe tavern keeper loudly complains that his daughter hasn't returned from gathering herbs in **Thornwick Forest**\u2014she left three days ago.\n\nRain begins pattering against the windows as night settles over the crossroads. The fire crackles invitingly, but adventure calls from beyond these walls.\n\nWhat draws your attention?",
