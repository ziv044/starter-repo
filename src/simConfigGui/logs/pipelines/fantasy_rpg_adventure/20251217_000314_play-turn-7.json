This small farming village sits nestled between rolling green hills and a dark forest that locals whisper about in hushed tones. Smoke rises from chimneys as villagers begin their daily routines\u2014merchants opening their shops, farmers heading to their fields with ox-drawn carts.\n\nYou are a traveling adventurer who arrived yesterday evening, your coin purse lighter than you'd prefer and your stomach reminding you that last night's thin stew wasn't nearly enough. The innkeeper mentioned you could earn some silver helping with odd jobs around town, but more intriguing rumors reached your ears in the common room:\n\n- **Strange lights** have been spotted deep in the Thornwood Forest, and livestock have gone missing near its edge\n- The village **blacksmith's daughter** vanished three days ago while gathering herbs\n- An **old watchtower** on the hill has been making odd noises at night, though it's been abandoned for decades\n\nThe village square bustles with modest activity. A weathered bulletin board stands near the well, and you notice several villagers casting worried glances toward the forest treeline.\n\nWhat do you do?",
