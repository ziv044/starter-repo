Outside, thunder rolls across the moors of Grimhaven Valley.\n\nA hooded figure at the bar catches your attention\u2014they've been glancing your way for the past hour. Near the hearth, a merchant argues in whispered tones with two travel-worn companions about \"the missing caravan\" and \"strange lights in Thornwick Forest.\" The barkeep, a grizzled dwarf named Korgan, polishes mugs while eyeing the darkening storm through the windows.\n\nThree paths seem to beckon from this humble crossroads:\n- The **North Road** leads to the port city of Saltmere through Thornwick Forest\n- The **East Road** winds toward the mining town of Ironhold in the mountains  \n- The **South Road** descends into the mysterious Whispering Marshlands\n\nA sudden flash of lightning illuminates the tavern, and in that brief moment, you notice the hooded figure has moved closer to your table. Rain pounds harder against the windows.\n\n*What do you do?*",
