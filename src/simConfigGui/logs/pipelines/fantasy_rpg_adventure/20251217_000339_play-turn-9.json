This ramshackle establishment sits at the junction of three ancient roads - one leading north to the mist-shrouded Thornwood, another winding east toward the trading city of Millhaven, and the third stretching south into the vast Ember Wastes.\n\nWarm yellow light spills from frost-kissed windows, and the muffled sounds of conversation and clinking ale mugs drift through the heavy oak doors. Above the entrance, a creaking sign depicts a compass rose surrounded by three winding paths.\n\nYou push open the door, and a wave of smoky warmth washes over you. The tavern is moderately busy this evening - a few local farmers nurse their drinks near the hearth, while a hooded figure sits alone in the far corner, occasionally glancing toward the door. The barkeep, a stout woman with graying hair, looks up from polishing a tankard.\n\n\"Welcome, traveler,\" she calls out. \"Name's Marta. What brings you to our humble crossroads on such a chill evening?\"\n\n*What do you do?*",
