Rain patters steadily against diamond-paned windows, and the wind howls through the eaves of this remote waystation where three ancient roads converge.\n\nMost travelers have retired for the night, leaving only you, the drowsy barkeep polishing mugs, and a hooded figure hunched over a barely-touched ale near the far wall. The stranger's fingers drum nervously against the scarred oak table.\n\nSuddenly, the tavern door bursts open with a crash. A young woman stumbles inside, her traveling cloak torn and muddy, eyes wide with terror. She scans the room frantically before her gaze locks onto you.\n\n\"Please,\" she gasps, rushing toward your table, \"you must help me! They took my brother\u2014dragged him into the Thornwood! The shadows... they weren't natural. I barely escaped with my life!\"\n\nThe hooded figure's head snaps up at her words, and you catch a glimpse of pale, scarred features beneath the cowl.\n\nThe barkeep sets down his mug with a heavy thud. \"Thornwood's been cursed for nigh on a century, girl. Ain't no one comes back from there.\"\n\nWhat do you do?",
