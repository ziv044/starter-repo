Mist clings to the cobblestones beneath your boots, and the air carries the scent of wet earth and something else\u2014something metallic and unsettling.\n\nThe four paths stretch before you like gnarled fingers: North toward the **Thornwick Mountains** where smoke rises from what should be abandoned peaks; East to the **Merchant's Road** where no caravans have passed in days; South into the **Darkwood** where strange lights flickered through the night; and West toward **Millbrook Village**, though the morning bell that should be ringing remains ominously silent.\n\nAt the crossroads' center stands an ancient waystone, its surface carved with warnings in the old tongue. Fresh scratches mar its base\u2014claw marks that gleam wet in the pale light. A torn piece of blue cloth flutters from a nearby thornbush, and you catch the faint sound of something moving through the mist behind you.\n\nThe world feels different this morning. Wrong somehow.\n\n**What do you do?**",
