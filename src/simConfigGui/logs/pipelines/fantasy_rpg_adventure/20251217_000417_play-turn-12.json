Rain patters against diamond-paned windows, and the murmur of conversations fills the smoky air. You've been traveling for days, your coin purse growing lighter with each mile.\n\nSuddenly, the tavern door bursts open with a crash. A cloaked figure stumbles inside, soaked to the bone and breathing heavily. Their hood falls back, revealing an elderly woman with wild silver hair and panic-filled eyes.\n\n\"Please!\" she gasps, scanning the room desperately. \"The shadows... they took my granddaughter! Into the Thornwick Forest!\" She clutches a small silver locket, her hands trembling. \"I can pay... I have little, but\u2014\"\n\nThe other patrons shift uncomfortably and return to their drinks, clearly wanting no part of whatever darkness lurks in those woods.\n\nThe woman's desperate gaze falls upon you.\n\n*What do you do?*",
