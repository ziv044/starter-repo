Flickering candlelight dances across weathered stone walls, casting long shadows between the scattered tables where locals nurse their drinks in hushed conversation.\n\nBehind the bar, a stout dwarf with braided beard polishes a tankard while eyeing you with curious interest. In the far corner, a hooded figure sits alone, occasionally glancing toward the door. Near the crackling hearth, two traveling merchants argue in low tones over a worn map spread between them.\n\nThrough the diamond-paned windows, you catch glimpses of the village of Millbrook settling into dusk. Lanterns begin to twinkle to life along the cobblestone streets, but beyond the village borders, the ancient Thornwick Forest looms dark and mysterious against the purple sky.\n\nThe dwarf barkeep calls out in a gravelly voice, \"Welcome, traveler! What brings you to our humble crossroads this evening? Ale, food, or perhaps... information?\"\n\n*The tavern falls slightly quieter, as if the other patrons are also curious about your answer.*\n\nWhat do you do?",
