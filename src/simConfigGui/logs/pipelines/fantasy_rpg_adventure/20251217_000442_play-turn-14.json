The village of Millhaven awakens slowly around you\u2014shutters creak open, smoke begins to curl from chimneys, and the distant lowing of cattle drifts from the surrounding pastures.\n\nBut something feels wrong this morning.\n\nThe usually bustling market square stands eerily empty, save for a lone figure hunched over by the ancient stone well at its center. As you approach, you recognize *Marta*, the village baker\u2014her flour-dusted apron now torn and dirty, her weathered face etched with worry.\n\nShe looks up at your approach, relief flooding her eyes. \"Oh, thank the gods! You must help us!\" she gasps, clutching your arm with trembling hands. \"They took them in the night\u2014*all* of them. The children... they're gone.\"\n\nBehind her, you notice deep gouges carved into the well's stone rim, as if made by massive claws. The metallic scent of blood lingers faintly in the cool air.\n\n\"The tracks lead north,\" Marta whispers, pointing toward the dark treeline of **Thornwood Forest**. \"But none of us dare follow. Please... you're our only hope.\"\n\n**What do you do?**",
