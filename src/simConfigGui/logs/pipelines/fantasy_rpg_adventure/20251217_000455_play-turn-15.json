The village, nestled between rolling hills and the edge of the Whispering Woods, has seen better days. Many of the thatched-roof cottages stand empty, their windows dark and doors barred shut.\n\nIn the village square, a weathered wooden notice board creaks in the gentle breeze, bearing hastily-scrawled messages and desperate pleas. The local tavern, *The Prancing Pony*, shows flickering candlelight through its windows despite the early hour, suggesting troubled souls seeking solace or perhaps plotting in hushed tones.\n\nTo the north, the ancient Whispering Woods loom dark and foreboding\u2014locals claim strange lights have been seen dancing between the trees at night. To the south, the old trade road stretches toward distant kingdoms, though fewer merchants brave this route lately.\n\nThe village bell tower chimes seven times, echoing across the eerily quiet streets. A perfect morning for a hero to arrive and perhaps uncover why this once-prosperous village now seems to hold its breath in fear.\n\n*What brings you to Millbrook on this misty morning, and from which direction do you approach?*",
