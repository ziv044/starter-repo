This humble establishment sits at the junction of three ancient roads: one leading north to the mountain passes, another winding east toward the coastal ports, and the third stretching south into the shadowed Thornwood.\n\nInside, the tavern buzzes with quiet conversation. A hooded figure in the corner nursing ale keeps glancing toward the door. The barkeep, a stout woman with knowing eyes, polishes mugs while listening to a travel-worn merchant complain about \"strange lights\" he witnessed in the northern peaks. Near the hearth, an old man traces symbols in spilled wine while muttering about forgotten ruins.\n\nThe autumn air carries whispers of change - traders speak of disrupted routes, strange creatures prowling familiar paths, and opportunities for those brave enough to seek them.\n\nThree roads stretch before you, each promising different adventures. The tavern's patrons seem eager to share tales and perhaps coin for the right sort of help.\n\n**What draws your attention first, traveler?**",
