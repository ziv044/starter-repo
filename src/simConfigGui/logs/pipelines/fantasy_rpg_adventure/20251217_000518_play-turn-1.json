You stand at the edge of a moss-covered clearing, your leather boots silent on the damp forest floor. The air is thick with the scent of pine and something else\u2014something unsettling that makes the hair on your neck rise.\n\nYour weathered traveling pack rests against your shoulder, containing your meager supplies: a handful of copper coins, dried rations for three days, a coil of rope, and a small tinderbox. At your side hangs a sturdy oak walking staff, its wood worn smooth from years of faithful service. A simple eating knife rests in your belt\u2014more tool than weapon, but sharp enough.\n\nBehind you, the forest path winds back toward the distant village of Millhaven, where worried whispers spoke of merchants gone missing and strange lights dancing between the trees at night. Ahead, the path splits three ways: one leads deeper into the shadowed heart of the woods, another curves toward what might be the glint of water through the trees, and the third climbs upward toward a rocky outcropping where ravens circle ominously.\n\nA twig snaps somewhere in the underbrush to your left.\n\nWhat do you do?",
