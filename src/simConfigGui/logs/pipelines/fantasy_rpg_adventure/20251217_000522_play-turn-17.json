You sit at a wooden table outside, nursing a mug of ale and taking stock of your modest belongings: a leather pack, a sturdy walking stick, and a purse containing 15 silver coins - enough for a few days' provisions, but hardly a fortune.\n\nThe tavern door creaks open behind you, releasing the warm glow of candlelight and the murmur of voices within. To your left, the Northern Path winds into dark pine forests where travelers speak of abandoned ruins. Straight ahead, the King's Road stretches toward distant merchant towns. To your right, a narrow trail disappears into misty marshlands.\n\nAs you contemplate your next move, three figures approach your table: a hooded merchant clutching a canvas satchel, a grizzled old hunter with worry lines etched deep in his weathered face, and a young woman in mud-stained traveling clothes who keeps glancing nervously over her shoulder.\n\nEach seems eager to speak with you, their eyes holding the weight of urgent business.\n\n**What do you do?**",
