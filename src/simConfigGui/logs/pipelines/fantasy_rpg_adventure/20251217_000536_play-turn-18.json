The air is thick with the scent of roasted meat, ale, and something else\u2014an undercurrent of fear that has settled over the common room like morning fog.\n\nYou sit alone at a corner table, nursing a tankard of bitter ale. Around you, hushed conversations die as quickly as they begin. The usual crowd of merchants, travelers, and local farmers seems unusually subdued tonight.\n\nBehind the bar, Gareth the innkeeper\u2014a stout man with worry lines etched deep around his eyes\u2014glances nervously toward the forest-facing windows. The normal evening chatter has been replaced by an oppressive quiet, broken only by the occasional creak of settling timber and the distant howl of wind through the trees.\n\nA hooded figure in a travel-stained cloak sits near the fireplace, occasionally glancing your way with calculating eyes. At another table, two local farmers speak in urgent whispers about \"strange lights\" and \"missing livestock.\"\n\nThe night is young, but something in the air suggests adventure\u2014or danger\u2014awaits.\n\n**What do you do?**",
