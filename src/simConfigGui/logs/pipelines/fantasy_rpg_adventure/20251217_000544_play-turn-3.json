The air hangs thick with pipe smoke and the aroma of roasted meat, while weathered patrons nurse their ales and speak in hushed tones.\n\nYour attention is drawn to three distinct conversations:\n\nAt the bar, a **hooded merchant** frantically whispers to the barkeep about \"strange lights in the Thornwood\" and missing caravans along the northern trade route.\n\nNear the fireplace, an **old veteran** with a scarred face regales listeners with tales of ancient ruins discovered in the Whispering Hills, claiming to have seen \"unnatural creatures\" emerging at twilight.\n\nBy the tavern's back door, a **nervous young woman** glances around desperately, clutching a sealed letter. She seems to be waiting for someone who hasn't arrived.\n\nThe tavern keeper rings the evening bell - it's nearly closing time. Rain begins pattering against the windows, and you notice your coin purse feels lighter than you'd prefer.\n\n*What draws your attention first, adventurer?*",
