Warm amber light spills from its diamond-paned windows, and the cheerful sounds of conversation and clinking tankards drift out into the cooling evening air.\n\nAbove the heavy oak door, a weathered sign creaks gently in the breeze, bearing the faded image of four roads meeting beneath a crescent moon. This inn has long served as a haven for travelers, merchants, and wanderers seeking rest before continuing their journeys into the unknown.\n\nAs you stand at the threshold, you notice something peculiar: despite the jovial atmosphere within, several hooded figures sit alone at corner tables, speaking in hushed tones. A travel-stained messenger clutches a sealed letter, glancing nervously toward the stairs. The innkeeper, a stout woman with knowing eyes, seems to be watching everyone with unusual interest.\n\nThe night is young, and the crossroads before you lead to the Whispering Woods to the north, the mining town of Ironhold to the east, the port city of Saltmere to the south, and the ancient ruins of Thornwatch to the west.\n\n*What draws your attention first, traveler?*",
