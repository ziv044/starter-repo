The morning air carries the scent of woodsmoke and freshly baked bread from the local tavern, *The Prancing Pony*.\n\nBut something feels... wrong.\n\nThe streets, which should be bustling with merchants and farmers preparing for market day, are eerily quiet. Most windows are shuttered tight despite the morning hour. Only a few villagers hurry past with their heads down, casting nervous glances toward the treeline.\n\nNear the village well, you notice **Gareth the Blacksmith** hammering frantically at his anvil, sweat beading on his brow despite the cool air. He looks up as you approach, relief washing over his weathered face.\n\n\"Thank the gods, a capable-looking soul!\" he calls out, setting down his hammer. \"You've not come from the western road, have you? Strange things have been happening... livestock going missing, eerie lights in the forest at night. Just yesterday, young Sara didn't return from gathering herbs near the old stone circle.\"\n\nHe wipes his hands on his leather apron, his eyes darting toward the shadowy forest beyond the village. \"The village elder's put out word - we need someone brave enough to investigate. There's coin in it, and...\" he lowers his voice, \"perhaps something more valuable if the old stories about that circle are true.\"\n\n**What do you do?**",
