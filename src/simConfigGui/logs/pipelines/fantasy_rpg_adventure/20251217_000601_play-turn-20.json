Behind you, thin wisps of smoke curl up from cottage chimneys, and the familiar sounds of daily life fade into a gentle murmur. Ahead, three weathered paths stretch into the unknown.\n\nTo the north, a well-traveled road winds toward the shadowy eaves of Thornwood Forest, where merchant caravans often require armed escorts. To the east, a rocky trail climbs toward the Copper Hills, where rumors speak of abandoned mines and strange lights seen at night. To the west, an overgrown path meanders toward the Mistral Marshlands, largely avoided by locals who whisper of things that lurk in the fog.\n\nA wooden signpost, carved with symbols worn smooth by countless seasons, marks each direction. The morning sun casts long shadows across your path, and a cool breeze carries the scent of adventure\u2014and perhaps danger.\n\nYour leather pack sits comfortably on your shoulders, your weapon rests within easy reach, and the world awaits your first choice.\n\n*What do you do?*",
