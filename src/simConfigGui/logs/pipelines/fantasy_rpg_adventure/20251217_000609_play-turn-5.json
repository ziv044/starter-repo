Thatched-roof cottages line the cobblestone main road, their chimneys already puffing wisps of smoke into the crisp air. The scent of fresh bread mingles with the earthy smell of dew-laden fields stretching toward distant forests.\n\nYou are a traveling adventurer who arrived in Millhaven late last night, seeking rest at the **Prancing Pony Inn**. The innkeeper, a stout woman named Martha, provided you with a simple room and mentioned troubling rumors over your evening meal - livestock have been disappearing from the outlying farms, and strange howls echo from the **Thornwood Forest** to the north.\n\nAs you step outside the inn this morning, you notice the village is unusually quiet. A few early risers hurry past with worried expressions, and you spot **Old Henrik** sitting on his porch, nervously whittling a piece of wood while glancing toward the forest path.\n\nThe village square lies ahead with several paths branching off - north toward the mysterious Thornwood, east to the farming homesteads, west toward the river crossing, and south back toward the main trade road.\n\nWhat do you choose to do?",
