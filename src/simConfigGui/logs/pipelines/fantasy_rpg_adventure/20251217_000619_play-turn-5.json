Outside, rain lashes against the diamond-paned windows while thunder rolls across the moors. You sit alone at a corner table, nursing a mug of ale that's grown cold in your hands.\n\nThe inn is nearly empty\u2014just you, the grizzled barkeeper polishing mugs with mechanical precision, and an old woman hunched over a steaming bowl of stew near the fire. The storm has driven most travelers to seek shelter elsewhere, or perhaps they know something about these roads that you don't.\n\nA sudden gust of wind slams the inn door open with a crash. A figure stumbles inside\u2014a young woman, soaked to the bone and wild-eyed with terror. She looks around desperately before her gaze fixes on you.\n\n\"Please,\" she gasps, water dripping from her dark hair. \"You have to help me. They took my brother... the things in the Thornwood. No one else will listen, but you\u2014you look like someone who might actually do something.\"\n\nThe barkeeper shakes his head grimly. \"Lass, I told you\u2014no good comes from those woods after dark. Best to let the dead stay buried.\"\n\nThe woman ignores him, taking a shaky step toward your table. Lightning illuminates her desperate face through the window.\n\nWhat do you do?",
