Rain pelts the diamond-paned windows, and the wind howls through the eaves of this roadside inn where three major trade routes converge.\n\nYou are a wandering adventurer who arrived here seeking shelter from the storm, but the conversations swirling around you hint at opportunities far more intriguing than dry clothes and warm food.\n\nAt a nearby table, a hooded merchant speaks in hushed tones about strange lights seen dancing above the ruins of Thornwick Abbey\u2014ruins that have been abandoned for over a century. By the hearth, an old woman clutches a letter with trembling hands, muttering about her grandson who disappeared while investigating reports of missing livestock near the Whispering Woods.\n\nThe tavern keeper, a stout man with graying temples, approaches your table with a concerned expression. \"Pardon the intrusion, friend,\" he says quietly, \"but you have the look of someone who's seen some trouble in your travels. These are strange times in our valley, and capable folk are becoming... scarce.\"\n\nThunder rumbles overhead as he glances toward the rain-soaked windows. \"Perhaps you might be interested in hearing more?\"\n\n**What do you do?**",
