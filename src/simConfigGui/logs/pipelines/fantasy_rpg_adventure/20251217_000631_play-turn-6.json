You sit in the corner booth, nursing a mug of lukewarm ale, watching the last of the night's patrons stumble toward the door. The tavern keeper, a burly man with graying temples, wipes down tables with practiced efficiency.\n\nThree days you've been in this backwater village, waiting. Waiting for word, for opportunity, for *something* to break the monotony of coin that grows lighter by the day.\n\nThe tavern door bursts open with a crash, and a young woman in mud-splattered traveling clothes stumbles inside. Her eyes are wide with terror, and she clutches a torn piece of parchment in her trembling hands.\n\n\"Please!\" she gasps, scanning the nearly empty room before her desperate gaze falls upon you. \"They took them all... the children... something terrible stalks the woods near Millhaven!\"\n\nThe tavern keeper freezes mid-wipe, his face paling. Outside, you can hear the distant sound of hoofbeats approaching fast.\n\nThe woman's eyes lock with yours, hope flickering in their depths. \"You look like someone who can handle a blade. Will you help us?\"\n\n**What do you do?**",
