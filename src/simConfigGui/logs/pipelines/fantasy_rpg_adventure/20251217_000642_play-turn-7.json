The warmth hits your face immediately\u2014a welcome relief from the cold autumn night. Flickering candlelight dances across worn wooden tables where travelers nurse their ales and speak in hushed tones.\n\nBehind the bar, a stout dwarf with braided beard polishes mugs with practiced efficiency. In the far corner, a hooded figure sits alone, occasionally glancing toward the stairs leading to the upper rooms. The fire crackles in the stone hearth, casting long shadows that seem to writhe and move.\n\nYou notice a weathered notice board near the entrance, covered with various postings\u2014some offering work, others warning of dangers on the roads. The tavern keeper looks up as you enter, nodding in greeting.\n\n\"Welcome, traveler. Foul night to be on the roads. What'll it be\u2014a room, a meal, or perhaps you're here about the notice old Henrik posted this morning?\"\n\n*What do you do?*",
