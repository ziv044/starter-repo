The village of Millhaven lies three days behind you now, along with the desperate pleas of its elder.\n\n*\"The children... they've been taken to the old ruins,\"* his voice echoes in your memory. *\"Strange lights dance there at night, and those who venture too close speak of haunting melodies that pull at the soul.\"*\n\nBefore you, the forest path splits in three directions: \n\n- To the **north**, smoke rises faintly through the canopy\u2014perhaps a woodcutter's camp, or something less benign\n- The **eastern** trail winds toward rocky hills where crumbling stone towers peek above the treeline\u2014the ruins the elder mentioned\n- **West** leads deeper into the dark heart of the forest, where even now you can hear the distant sound of running water\n\nA raven caws overhead, its black eyes seeming to study you with unnatural intelligence. The morning air carries an odd metallic taste, and you notice the forest seems unusually quiet\u2014no birdsong, no rustling of small creatures.\n\nSomething stirs in the shadows between the trees. You are not alone.\n\n**What do you do?**",
