Behind you stretches the familiar cobblestone road leading back to your village, while ahead lies the notorious Whispering Woods\u2014a realm where few dare to tread.\n\nYour leather pack weighs heavy on your shoulders, containing the meager supplies you could gather: a worn traveling cloak, a simple iron dagger at your belt, a handful of copper coins, and dried provisions for perhaps three days. The village elder's words echo in your mind: *\"The merchant caravan vanished three nights past on the old forest road. Their cargo contained medicine desperately needed for the fever that plagues our children.\"*\n\nThe morning air carries an unnatural chill, and you swear you can hear faint whispers drifting from between the gnarled oak trees ahead. Strange blue-green moss clings to the bridge's ancient stones, pulsing gently with an otherworldly light.\n\nTo your left, a narrow deer path winds down into the ravine. Straight ahead, the main road disappears into the forest's shadowy depths. To your right, you notice fresh wheel ruts leading off the road toward a cluster of standing stones partially hidden by brambles.\n\nThe choice is yours, brave soul. Where will your quest begin?",
