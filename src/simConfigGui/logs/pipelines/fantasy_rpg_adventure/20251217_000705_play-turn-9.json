Rain patters steadily against diamond-paned windows, and the fire in the great hearth crackles, casting dancing shadows across the faces of other travelers seeking shelter from the storm.\n\nYou are a seasoned adventurer, your leather armor worn but reliable, a steel sword resting at your hip alongside a sturdy dagger. Your traveling pack sits beside your chair, containing basic supplies: a coil of rope, a tinderbox, some dried rations, and a small pouch holding 15 silver coins.\n\nThe tavern keeper, a burly man with graying temples, approaches your table with concern etched across his weathered face.\n\n\"Stranger,\" he says in a low voice, glancing nervously toward the stairs leading to the upper rooms, \"I hate to burden a guest, but I find myself in desperate need of someone with... particular skills. One of my guests went up to her room three hours ago and hasn't made a sound since. The door's locked from the inside, but something feels terribly wrong.\"\n\nHe wrings his hands anxiously. \"Would you be willing to investigate? I'll waive your room fee for the night, and there might be coin in it if you can sort this mess out.\"\n\n**What do you do?**",
