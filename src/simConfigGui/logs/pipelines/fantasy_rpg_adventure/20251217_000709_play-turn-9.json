Three days you've been tracking the missing merchant caravan through these forsaken woods, following cold trails and broken wagon wheel marks that grow fainter with each passing hour.\n\nYour stomach gnaws with hunger, and your waterskin grows light. The local villagers' coins jingle in your pouch\u2014payment promised for finding their missing kin, but only if you return with answers.\n\nAs you pack your meager belongings, a sound cuts through the forest's natural symphony: the distinctive *crack* of breaking branches, too deliberate to be caused by wind or small game. It comes from deeper in the woods, perhaps a hundred paces northeast, where the trees grow thick and the shadows never fully retreat.\n\nThrough the gaps in the canopy above, you glimpse something that makes your blood run cold\u2014thin tendrils of black smoke rising in the distance, far too dark and oily to be from any normal campfire.\n\nThe forest watches you with countless unseen eyes, waiting for your next move.
