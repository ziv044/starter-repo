Rain patters against diamond-paned windows while the hearth crackles warmly nearby. The tavern buzzes with hushed conversations - merchants discussing blocked trade routes, farmers whispering about strange lights seen in the Thornwood Forest, and a hooded figure in the far corner nursing an untouched ale.*\n\n*The barkeep, a stout woman named Marta, approaches your table with a concerned expression.*\n\n**Marta:** \"Haven't seen you 'round these parts before, traveler. Name's Marta - I run this place. You picked an interesting night to arrive... three caravans failed to make it through Thornwood this week. Guards found 'em empty, goods scattered like something scared the horses into bolting.\"\n\n*She leans closer, lowering her voice.*\n\n**Marta:** \"Folk are saying it's bandits, but I've heard... other things. The kind of things that make grown men cross themselves twice before speaking. What brings you to our little crossroads?\"\n\n*Thunder rumbles overhead as you notice the hooded figure has turned slightly in your direction, listening.*\n\nWhat do you do?",
