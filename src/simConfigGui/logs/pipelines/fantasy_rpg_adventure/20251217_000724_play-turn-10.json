The air is thick with the scent of roasted meat, ale, and something else\u2014tension. \n\nYou find yourself in the bustling common room of what locals call \"the last civilized stop\" before the Thornwood Wilds. Weathered travelers nurse their drinks in shadowed corners, their eyes darting nervously toward the windows where darkness has already claimed the forest beyond. The tavern keeper, a stout woman with graying braids, wipes down mugs with mechanical precision, her brow furrowed with worry.\n\nAt a table near the fire, an old man in a mud-stained traveling cloak gestures frantically to anyone who will listen. \"Three days now!\" he rasps. \"The merchant caravan should have returned three days ago! Something's taken them in those cursed woods, mark my words!\"\n\nA few patrons shift uncomfortably, while others pointedly ignore the man's outburst. The tavern keeper catches your eye and nods toward an empty table, then glances meaningfully at the distressed traveler.\n\nThe night is young, and choices await. What draws your attention first in this crossroads between safety and the unknown?",
