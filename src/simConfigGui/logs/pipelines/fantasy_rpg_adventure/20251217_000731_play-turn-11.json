You stand at the forest's edge, where the well-worn cobblestone road from the village of Millhaven abruptly ends, giving way to a narrow dirt path that disappears into the shadowy depths ahead.\n\nBehind you, the warm glow of the village lanterns flickers in the distance\u2014a comforting sight that grows smaller with each passing moment. The air here carries strange scents: wild honeysuckle mixed with something darker, more primal. Somewhere in the canopy above, an owl calls out, its haunting cry echoing through the trees.\n\nYour leather satchel weighs heavy on your shoulder, containing the precious medicine that old Healer Meredith desperately needs. The fastest route to the neighboring town of Ravenshollow cuts straight through these woods, but the locals whispered warnings before you left\u2014tales of strange lights, missing travelers, and creatures that walk on two legs but are decidedly not human.\n\nA cool breeze stirs the leaves, and you notice something peculiar: carved into the bark of the massive oak beside the path entrance is a symbol\u2014three interlocking circles surrounding what appears to be an eye.\n\nThe path beckons. Darkness is falling, and time grows short.\n\nWhat do you choose to do?",
