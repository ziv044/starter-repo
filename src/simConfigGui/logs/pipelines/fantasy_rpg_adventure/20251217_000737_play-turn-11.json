This humble inn sits at the junction of three ancient roads - one leading north to the dwarven holds, another east toward the coastal cities, and the third winding south into the mysterious Thornwood.\n\nThe tavern buzzes with hushed conversations. A hooded merchant in the corner keeps glancing nervously at the door. The barkeep, a stout woman named Marta, wipes glasses while eyeing a weathered notice board covered in job postings and wanted posters.\n\nLightning illuminates the night beyond the windows, followed by thunder that seems to shake the very foundations. Through the storm's chaos, you catch sight of a lone rider approaching at desperate speed, their horse lathered and stumbling.\n\nThe tavern door suddenly bursts open. A young woman staggers inside, soaked to the bone, her eyes wide with terror. \"Please!\" she gasps, scanning the room. \"My village... Millhaven... it's gone! They're all gone!\"\n\nThe tavern falls silent except for the storm outside. Every face turns toward the stranger - and toward you.\n\n**What do you do?**",
