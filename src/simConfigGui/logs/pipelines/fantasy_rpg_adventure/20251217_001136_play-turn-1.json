Millhaven is a humble farming village, barely more than a cluster of thatched cottages surrounding this single inn. Your worn leather armor bears the marks of travel, and your trusty sword rests against the wooden table beside a small coinpurse containing your last few silver pieces.\n\nThe innkeeper, a stout woman named Marta, approaches with worry creasing her brow. \"Stranger,\" she says quietly, glancing toward the other patrons, \"you have the look of someone who's seen trouble. We... we might have need of such a person.\"\n\nShe leans closer, lowering her voice. \"Children have been disappearing. Three in the past fortnight. The village guard is just old Henrik with his rusty spear, and the nearest lord's garrison is days away. Last night, young Tam saw strange lights dancing in the Thornwood Forest before he vanished.\"\n\nHer weathered hands tremble slightly as she places a small leather pouch on the table. \"It's not much - thirty silver coins - but it's all we can spare. Will you help us?\"\n\nOutside, night is falling, and somewhere in the darkness beyond the village, the Thornwood Forest awaits.\n\n**What do you do?**",
