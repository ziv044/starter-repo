The air is thick with morning mist and the earthy scent of moss and fallen leaves. You are a traveler on the Old King's Road, but something has drawn you from the well-worn path into these darker woods.\n\nBehind you, your horse whickers nervously, ears twitching at sounds you cannot hear. The beast refuses to go further, stamping its hooves against the soft earth carpeted with years of decay.\n\nAhead, the forest seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy. Strange, luminescent mushrooms dot the bases of gnarled trees, and you catch glimpses of movement in your peripheral vision\u2014though nothing is there when you turn to look directly.\n\nA fork in the barely-visible deer trail presents itself before you:\n\nTo the **left**, the path winds upward toward what appears to be ancient stone ruins peeking through the treeline, where an eerie blue light flickers.\n\nTo the **right**, the trail descends toward the sound of running water, where melodic voices seem to drift on the breeze\u2014though no words can be distinguished.\n\nBehind you, your horse snorts again, more urgently this time. Something is moving through the underbrush in the distance, following your trail.\n\nWhat do you do?",
