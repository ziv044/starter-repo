Warm amber light spills from the frost-touched windows, accompanied by the low murmur of conversation and the occasional clink of pewter mugs.\n\nThe tavern sits at the intersection of three well-traveled roads: the King's Highway stretching north toward the capital, the Trader's Path winding east through merchant towns, and the Old Forest Road disappearing south into shadowy woodlands. A wooden sign bearing a compass rose sways overhead, marking this as a place where destinies often change direction.\n\nInside, you glimpse weathered travelers hunched over steaming bowls, their mud-caked boots and travel-worn gear telling tales of distant places. A hooded figure in the corner booth catches your attention briefly before turning away. The tavern keeper, a stout woman with knowing eyes, polishes glasses while listening intently to hushed conversations.\n\nOutside, your horse stamps restlessly, as if sensing something stirring in the gathering dusk. The autumn air carries whispers of coming change - and perhaps, opportunity.\n\n*What do you do?*",
