Before you stands the Crossroads Tavern, its windows glowing warmly with amber light that spills onto the street. The wooden sign creaks gently in the evening breeze, depicting a traveler's pack crossed with a silver sword.\n\nThrough the thick-paned windows, you glimpse the silhouettes of patrons hunched over their drinks, their animated conversations a low murmur that mingles with the distant lowing of cattle from nearby farms. The scent of roasted meat and fresh bread drifts from within, beckoning weary travelers.\n\nTo your left, the cobblestone road winds northward toward the shadowy outline of the Thornwood Forest, where local rumors speak of strange lights and missing merchants. To your right, the path leads south toward the bustling port city of Seahaven, three days' ride away.\n\nBehind you, the village of Millbrook settles into evening quiet - chimney smoke rises from modest cottages, and the blacksmith's hammer falls silent for the day.\n\nA weathered notice board beside the tavern door bristles with parchments - job postings, warnings, and calls for aid that flutter in the gentle wind.\n\nWhat do you do?",
