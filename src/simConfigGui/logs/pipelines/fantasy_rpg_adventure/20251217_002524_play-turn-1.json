Flickering candlelight dances across worn stone walls, casting long shadows between the rough-hewn tables where a handful of travelers nurse their ales in hushed conversation. The air is thick with the mingled scents of roasted meat, wood smoke, and something less pleasant\u2014the lingering odor of too many unwashed bodies seeking shelter from the autumn rains.\n\nBehind the bar, a burly innkeeper with graying hair polishes a tankard while eyeing the room's occupants. To your left, a hooded figure sits alone in the corner, occasionally glancing toward the door with nervous energy. Near the hearth, two merchants in travel-stained cloaks argue in low voices over a piece of parchment spread between them.\n\nThrough the rain-streaked windows, you can see the crossroads themselves\u2014four muddy paths stretching into the darkness beyond the tavern's warm glow. One leads north toward the Thornwood Forest, another south to the mining town of Redstone, while the eastern path winds toward the capital city of Valdris. The western route disappears into mist-shrouded hills where few dare to travel.\n\nThe tavern falls quiet as you survey the scene. Several pairs of eyes turn your way, measuring, calculating. What draws your attention first?",
