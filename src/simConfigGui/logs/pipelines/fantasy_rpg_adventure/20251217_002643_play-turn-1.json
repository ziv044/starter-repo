The familiar warmth of hearth-fire and the buzz of evening conversation wash over you. Oil lamps flicker against weathered stone walls adorned with faded maps and trophies from long-forgotten hunts.\n\nYou've spent the last three days traveling the King's Road from the capital, carrying little more than your weapons, a handful of silver coins, and a burning desire to forge your own destiny. The tavern keeper, a stout woman with graying braids, nods toward an empty table near the corner where shadows dance.\n\nAs you settle in with a mug of ale, fragments of conversation drift from nearby tables:\n\n\"...strange lights in the Thornwood again last night...\"\n\n\"...merchant caravan three days overdue from Millbrook...\"\n\n\"...old Gareth swears he saw something moving in the ruins north of town...\"\n\nThe tavern door creaks open behind you, letting in a gust of cool evening air and a cloaked figure who scans the room with urgent eyes.\n\n**What do you do?**\n\n*Your adventure begins at the threshold of opportunity. Choose your path carefully.*",
