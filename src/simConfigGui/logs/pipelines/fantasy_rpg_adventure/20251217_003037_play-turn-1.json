The warmth hits you immediately\u2014crackling hearth fire, the rich aroma of roasted meat, and the low murmur of hushed conversations.\n\nFlickering candlelight dances across worn wooden tables where hooded travelers nurse their ales with suspicious eyes. Rain pelts the diamond-pane windows, and somewhere in the shadows, a cloaked figure hastily rolls up a parchment as you enter.\n\nThe tavern keeper\u2014a stout woman with graying braids\u2014glances up from polishing a pewter mug. \"Another soul seeking shelter from the storm, eh? Welcome, traveler. Though I'd choose your seat carefully tonight...\" Her eyes dart meaningfully toward a corner table where two men in tattered cloaks whisper urgently over a flickering map.\n\nThe storm outside intensifies, as if the very roads themselves are restless. Lightning illuminates a wooden notice board near the door, covered in yellowed bounties and cryptic job postings that flutter with each gust of wind.\n\nWhat draws your attention first in this crossroads of destinies?",
