The late afternoon sun casts long shadows across thatched roofs and cobblestone paths, while wisps of smoke curl up from chimney tops into the amber sky.\n\nThe village seems peaceful enough\u2014chickens peck at the ground near modest cottages, and you can hear the distant *thunk-thunk* of an axe splitting wood. But there's an undercurrent of unease here. Windows are shuttered despite the pleasant weather, and the few villagers you glimpse hurry about their business with nervous glances toward the darkening forest that looms beyond the settlement's edge.\n\nA weathered signpost at the crossroads points in three directions: **North** to \"Greystone Keep - 2 days,\" **East** to \"The Thornwood,\" and **West** to \"Riverside Trading Post.\" The fourth direction, back **South**, simply reads \"The Old Road.\"\n\nJust ahead, warm golden light spills from the windows of **The Prancing Pony Inn**, and you can hear the muffled sounds of conversation and clinking mugs within. A stable boy tends to horses in the yard, occasionally casting worried looks toward the treeline.\n\nThe crossroads await your choice, traveler. What draws your attention first?",
