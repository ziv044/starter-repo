You sit at a corner table, nursing the last drops of bitter ale from your tankard as pale sunlight filters through grimy windows. The tavern keeper, a burly man named Garrett, wipes down mugs behind the bar while humming an old traveling song.\n\n\"Rough night, friend?\" Garrett calls over, noticing your contemplative stare toward the window. \"You've been nursing that drink since before the rooster crowed.\"\n\nThrough the diamond-paned glass, you can see the cobblestone crossroads that give this establishment its name. Four paths stretch away into the distance: \n\n- North leads toward the **Whispering Woods**, where morning mist still clings to ancient oaks\n- East winds toward **Millbrook Village**, smoke rising from cottage chimneys  \n- South heads into **Thorndale Hills**, rocky and wild\n- West beckons toward the **Old Stone Bridge**, spanning a rushing river\n\nA weathered notice board by the tavern door is covered in parchments - bounties, requests for aid, and rumors from traveling merchants. The morning air carries the scent of adventure and possibility.\n\nWhat draws your attention first, traveler?",
