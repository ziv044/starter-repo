Rain drums against diamond-paned windows while inside, a motley crew of sellswords, cutthroats, and desperate folk huddle over their drinks.\n\nAt a corner table, three cloaked figures lean close together, their hushed conversation punctuated by the glint of gold changing hands. One slides a leather pouch across the scarred wooden surface while whispering urgently: *\"The caravan leaves at dawn... no witnesses, you understand? Kill them all.\"*\n\nThe tavern keeper, a grizzled man with nervous eyes, notices your arrival and quickly looks away. A wanted poster on the wall catches the firelight - your own face stares back, with \"DEAD OR ALIVE\" scrawled beneath in blood-red ink.\n\nLightning illuminates the room as thunder crashes overhead. The three conspirators rise from their table, hands moving to concealed weapons as they notice you. The tavern falls silent except for the crackling fire and your own heartbeat.\n\n**What do you do?**\n\n*The tension is thick as morning fog, and violence seems as inevitable as the storm raging outside...*",
