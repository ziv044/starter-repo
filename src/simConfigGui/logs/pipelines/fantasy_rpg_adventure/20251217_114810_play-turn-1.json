The common room buzzes with hushed conversations that seem to die as strangers glance your way. Flickering candlelight dances across weathered faces - merchants, sellswords, and travelers all seeking shelter from both the storm and whatever troubles drove them to this remote waystation.\n\nBehind the bar, a burly innkeeper with graying hair catches your eye and nods toward an empty table near the hearth. As you settle in, you notice a hooded figure in the corner frantically stuffing a rolled parchment into their satchel. Their hands shake as they scan the room, eyes wide with fear.\n\nSuddenly, the tavern door bursts open. Three figures in dark leather armor stride in, rain streaming from their cloaks. The lead figure pulls back his hood, revealing a scarred face and cold eyes that methodically sweep the room. The hooded figure in the corner goes rigid with terror.\n\n\"We're looking for someone,\" the scarred man announces, his voice cutting through the tavern's chatter like a blade. \"A thief who stole something very valuable from our employer.\"\n\nThe atmosphere grows thick with tension. What do you do?",
