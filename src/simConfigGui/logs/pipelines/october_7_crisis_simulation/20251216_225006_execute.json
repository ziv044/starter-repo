Initial reports indicate dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers have been killed or taken hostage in what military experts are calling the most significant penetration of Israeli territory since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\nRockets are still streaming from Gaza, overwhelming Iron Dome defenses. Multiple Israeli towns near the border have been overrun, with graphic reports of civilian massacres emerging. The Israeli government has declared a state of war, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising a \"devastating response\" and mobilizing reserve forces for what appears to be an imminent large-scale military operation.\n\nInternational shock is palpable. The United States has condemned the attack in strongest possible terms, while regional tensions are escalating rapidly. This is not merely a border skirmish, but potentially the beginning of a transformative conflict with profound regional and global implications.",
